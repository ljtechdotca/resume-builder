    ☐ anything to do with the droppables, draggables, and field/fields is probably yucky and can be improved somewhere
        ✔ Draggable @done(22-09-26 17:01)
        ✔ Droppable @done(22-09-26 17:02)
        ✔ Field @done(22-09-26 18:45)
            ✔ make a component for the "deactivated" field @done(22-09-26 18:44)
            FieldInfo
                maybe change the UI when I get an idea what I'd like it to look like

other:
    ☐ create another cv component
    ☐ refactor the business card
        print more than one card on a page
        front and back layouts/ sides / versions
    ☐ color input
    ☐ input for uploading an image to the previewed layout
        used for the alternate cv and maybe for business card logos
