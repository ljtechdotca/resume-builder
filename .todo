    form inputs:
        ☐ startDate vs. endDate, startEnd cannot be greater than endDate, endDate cannot be less than startDate

        ✔ the color red sucks no more @done(22-09-21 14:58)

        ☐ responsive design
            cant view the website on anything smaller than a desktop

        ☐ create a diaglog box for modal

        ☐ some forms are weird to use
            titles are used as the key for each Item (work history, education, skills, etc.)
            because of this, if you go to "Add" an Item with a title that already exists, it will update an existing record

        ✔ create a global theme @done(22-09-21 14:46)
        
    forms:

        ✔ remove useless form buttons (on change) @done(22-09-21 14:58)

        ✔ reduce the weird functions @done(22-09-20 15:19)

        ☐ improve overall user experience
            make it easier to fill the resume, use visual indications of missing required fields

        ✔ add the form functions back @done(22-09-21 14:46)
            all the forms are held on Forms.tsx now, I didn't move functionality over yet (on App.tsx still)
