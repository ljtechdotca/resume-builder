    ui:
        ✔ SimpleColumn CV undefined values @done(22-09-16 16:30)
            things like the contact address shows floating commas when no data is present
            resume looks boring when nothing is filled out, maybe have some default data that takes its place and is greyed out?

        ✔ Preview is much larger than the "printed" pdf version @done(22-09-17 14:41)
            things such as fontsize and the layout change between printed and preview versiosn
            this is because the preview doesn't use exact sizes, and the text size remains the same between both versions
            fixing the preview layout dimensions will fix this (and then using transform scale on top of it)
